# Ideas for improvement
- As [noted](https://github.com/ries07uw/HathiTrustYAMLgenerator/blob/master/HowTo.md#note), support for books read from right to left is limited. Improving capability to generate YAML files for such items is a potential area for improvement in the Python script.
- If there are unenumerated pages in the middle of a roman numeral section, the script will include the unenumerated pages and not adjust the page count like with regular pages.
